            <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
            <p>Feel free to explore my website. I cannot confirm or deny the existence of easter eggs in this site. If
                there are easter eggs, they probably wouldn't be listed in the sitemap or the navigation menu, you would
                have to go to them manually through the URL bar.</p>
