                <p><strong>I am currently redesigning the UI of my website. SOME THINGS WILL BE BROKEN!!! Please disregard issues and broken UI for the time being. Sorry for the inconvience.</strong></p>

                <h2>What is this website?</h2>
                <p>This website is Home of all things about me, Zane Sanders. I created this website at the age of 16. I plan to house the majority of my internet footprint here, on this very website. This website will have many things I publish to the Internet. It will store everything from my YouTube videos to my resume.</p>

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I'm Zane Sanders, a 16-year-old from the USA who has interests in math, science, drawing, programming, and game development. I'm autistic and have ADHD. Although people have told me that I'm smart and capable of achieving great things, I'm unsure of what those "great things" might be. Some people compare me to famous individuals such as Einstein, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Paul Allen, and even the many stories of Elon Musk's teenage years. I have many ideas, but I struggle to write them down before forgetting them. I am uncertain about my future career path but I'm interested in technology and currently considering web development and hardware engineering.</p>

                <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
                <p>Feel free to explore my website. I cannot confirm or deny the existence of easter eggs in this site. If there are easter eggs, they probably wouldn't be listed in the sitemap or the navigation menu, you would have to go to them manually through the URL bar.</p>
