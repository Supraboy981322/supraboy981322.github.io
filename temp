<h5>Company Salaries</h5>
                        <div class="content-text-box"><b>An alternative way of setting up a company's employee (and CEO) salary: Salaries would be based purely on risk factor. There would be 4 different grades for risk factor; no risk, minor injuries may occur, possibility of being hospitalized, and risk of death. However, since the CEO is the brains of a company, he can only be payed as much as the company's riskiest job. The company divides up the entire company revenue into 2 categories, company needs, and salaries. The company can ONLY spend their company needs money on necessities to run, e.g. supplies, tax, and utility bills. Neither the CEO nor employees can use the company needs money for their own benefit. The company needs money is subtracted from the total revenue, then it is divided amongst the employees (and CEO) based on the job risk factor.</b></div>
