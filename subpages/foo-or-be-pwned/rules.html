            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>First step (as of <strong>most</strong> card games) is to suffle the cards. The uneven cards go in a separate stack and are to be shuffled separatly.</p>
            <p>First person to guess who has their wifi password as a phone number and get it correct starts (No guessing what the number is)</p>
            <p>The player to the right of the player who's turn is active pulls a question card (the mostly evenly sized stack of cards) and reads the question. (The answer is boxed)</p>
            <p>If the player gets the question correct, they pull a card from the unevenly sized cards</p>
            <p>"Foo" cards are good and "PWNED" cards are bad. You must do what the card says. If you pull a "Foo or PWNED" card, your fate is in the hands of the next player. If they get the question wrong or pull a "PWNED" card, you do Foo, but if they pull a "Foo" card, you get PWNED</p>
            <p>After you pull a card and accept it's challenge, you are to keep it until the round is over.</p>
            <p>The game keeps going until you must stop or all uneven cards have been used.</p>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the other players to insure that each player will complete the challenges assigned to them, even if the game ends before completion.</p>
