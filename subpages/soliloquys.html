    <p class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>An alternative way of setting up a company's employee (and CEO) salary:
        Salaries would be based purely on risk factor. There would be 4 different grades for risk factor; no risk, minor
        injuries may occur, possibility of being hospitalized, and risk of death. However, since the CEO is the brains
        of a company, he can only be payed as much as the company's riskiest job. The company divides up the entire
        company revenue into 2 categories, company needs, and salaries. The company can ONLY spend their company needs
        money on necessities to run, e.g. supplies, tax, and utility bills. Neither the CEO nor employees can use the
        company needs money for their own benefit. The company needs money is subtracted from the total revenue, then it
        is divided amongst the employees (and CEO) based on the job risk factor.</b></p>

        that ChatGPT should be taught in schools. Schools teach how to use calculators to assist with math, even though
        the calculator is perfectly capable of doing the whole equation by itself, so why not teach ChatGPT? To be
        clear, this can be applied to any large language model, not just ChatGPT.</b></p>

        properly put into words)</b></h2>
    <p class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>While many may oppose, I believe that goals are depressing. Sure goals can
        give you something to look forward to, push you to be better, get through the day, or simply keep you busy, but
        if you fail to accomplish your goals, you could do more harm than the good caused by achieving it. If you simply
        miss 2 or 3 goals in a row, you would significantly decrease morale, no matter how enthusiastic or upbeat you
        may be.</b></p>

    <h3 class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>Background knowledge:</b></h3>
    <p class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>At the time of writing this, Retroid is a handheld Android gaming hardware
        manufacturer that releases new consoles sometimes several times a month and so frequently that people are
        starting to switch to other brands because of buyers remorse due to the company making the hardware obsolete
        before the consumer can be satisfied with their purchase.</b></p>
    <h3 class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>Soliloquy:</b></h3>
    <p class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>Retroid's idea might be that the more systems they release and the more
        frequent they release them might mean more customers in their eyes because they have more options to appease a
        customer that might not have bought a retroid otherwise. However, I do agree that the releasing these consoles
        this frequently will give their customers a sour tsste because they associated Retroid with the regret of buying
        one and something better coming out right after. So i can see where they are coming from, but I agree that they
        should slow down a bit and take more time to optimize software and hardware before releasing a new hardware. If
        they take the same approach that phone manufacturers take by releasing maybe 3 phones a year around the same
        time, one low end, one mid range, and one high end, they probably would strike an even balence.</b></p>

    <h2 class="all-pages-text-box-title"><b>Just because you bought a digital game or movie, doesn't mean you own it.
        (Jul 21, 2023)</b></h2>
    <p class="all-pages-text-box-content"><b>If I don't own anything, I won't buy anything. The gaming industry believes
        if you buy a digital game, you don't own it, you're renting it. It is wrong for a man to sell someone a house
        and take it back when he wants more money, but it is perfectly fine if a company sells someone a game and
        revokes access after a few years because they want you to buy the remaster or the sequel. For example, if you
        bought Trackmania from the Microsoft store, then a day later it is removed from the Microsoft store, you lose
        access to the game and it is automatically uninstalled from your device. HOW IS THIS LEGAL‽ Microsoft and
        Ubisoft and EA and many others seem to thing that pressing the "buy" button on a digital game doesn't mean that
        you OWN the game, but you are RENTING the game at full price. As of this very moment, they do not mention this
        anywhere in their terms of service nor when you "purchase" the game. If you are renting the game, then why does
        it say "buy" on the button and "purchased" when the transaction goes through? Why doesn't it say "rent" and
        "enjoy while you can?"HOW IS THIS LEGAL‽ I don't understand why this type of thing isn't talked about yet. The
        gaming industry isn't even the only one doing this, Amazon is doing it too with their video streaming service.
        Amazon's video streaming service even says "buy to own" and they have a separate button that says "rent." It
        should say "rent" and "rent plus" or "rent premium."</b></p>

        Mental disabilities do not always mean dumb

        A mental disability just means they have another obstacle to overcome

        A mental disability just means it is harder for them

        A mental disability just means success is an extra slippery thing to grasp
