      <h2 class="all-pages-text-box-title">What is Study Break?</h2>
      <div class="all-pages-text-box-content"><p>Study Break is a program I made to help me and others study. While there are other options out there, this one's probably one of a few made by a 10th grader in his spare time at school. Plus, Study Break may be the first web-based option created in Scratch and hosted on a dedicated website. Sure the other options may be better, but Study Break is unique in many ways.</p></div>

    <h2 class="all-pages-text-box-title">Why did I make Study Break?</h2>
    <div class="all-pages-text-box-content"><p>I created Study Break because I find that I learn best by taking actual tests. I have used other web-based studying programs, but I wanted to make a studying program that I can call my own. So, Study Break was born and it can be used by anyone and accessed from anywhere where internet roams.</p></div>

    <h2 class="all-pages-text-box-title">How was development?</h2>
    <div class="all-pages-text-box-content"><p>Study Break originally just a program that I created over the course of roughly a total of 10 hours. However, development was spread throughout several days and I only worked on it during my free time at school. I didn't originally intend for it to become a website when I started creating the program, but I decided to make it into a website so it's more accessible. I created Study Break in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> using the <a href="https://turbowarp.org/" target="_blank">TurboWarp</a> editor and packager.</p></div>
