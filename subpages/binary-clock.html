            <h2>How do I read this?</h2>
            <p>This clock may look hard to read at first, but with some practice, you can read this clock just as quickly as the one on your phone. To read binary numbers, you need to do some basic addition.</p>
            <p>First, you check the location of each binary 1, (or in the case of my clock, the green circle). Then you add each value for the binary 1s. The numbers go up in value from right to left.</p>
            <p>In the picture below, you can see that there are 1s in the 2, 4, and 16 places. So you add 2+4+16, and you get the number that is being represented. In the case of the example below, it's representing the number 22.</p>
