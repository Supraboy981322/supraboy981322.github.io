        <h5>Stoichiometric Bi-cycloptic Rage:</h5>
         <div class="content-text-box">
            <p>There once was a person named "The." "The" had a problem. "The"'s pet named "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination" was sick. So "The" left his house to bring "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination" to a vet named "UserId:34578932475" who worked at a place named "Doctor's complex." "The" died from a heart attack and "UserId:34578932475"'s finger slipped, killing "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination." "UserId:34578932475" was killed by a stray bullet after work while walking to his car, and "Doctor's complex" blew up, destroying everything within 5,652,733 miles.</p>
                <p>For some reason, unknown to the narrator, a strand of DNA has appeared on a separate planet in the Andromeda Galaxy. Remembering what he was looking for, he went to search for his keys. "The" then dived into the Milky-Way's central blackhole. "The" found his keys. However, he was never seen again, because nothing, other than light, can escape a blackhole, also "The" would be speggetified.</p>
                <p>This wasn't the end however; "The" found himself, somehow, in *another* planet. This mission to find his keys has become exponential. He looked around the magical land he was in. There was a candy cane forest, in which "The" found a cabin. He began to knock  at the door. "Hello? Anyone there?" He received no response. "Nobody must be home," he said to himself. "The" went on to explore more of his surroundings, finding unnatual terrain everywhere.</p>
                <p>Then, God, the teenager living in his mom's basement pressed "close application" when the universe simulator stopped responding. He was distraught to find out his progress didn't save. He only had 5 minutes to recover it before it was lost forever.</p>
                <p>Turns out, that data was only half recovered. This meant trouble for God. "This is going to be more difficult than I thought," God said to himself. He had to figure out how to fix this, and fast. He decided the only thing he could do was to restart his computer in hopes that it was all just a bug. It turned out that it was, so he signed with relief. God restored his previous save, from before humanity fell to crap. God said "It is good."</p>
