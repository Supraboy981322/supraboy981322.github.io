    <div class="all-pages-text-box-content"><p>Here me out, if the house is on stilts, the dog is on the chair, and so on, then why are the wheels on the car? The arguement of the car being the largest object and therefore, the wheels are on the car can't hold any ground. Again, the house is on stilts, not the stilts are on the house, the dog is on the chair, not the chair is on the dog. If the chair were on the dog, that would imply that the chair is ontop, but if the wheels are on the car, wouldn't they be ontop too? The arguement that everyone else says it like that and it's <i>socially</i> correct, doesn't mean that it's <i>actually gramatically</i> correct. Anything can be <i>socially</i> correct, but that doesn't mean that it <i>is</i> correcct. For example, it is <i>socially</i> correct to curse when in the company of close friends, but that <i>doesn't mean that it is correct</i> to curse. Just because it is socially acceptable doesn't to pronounce something one way does mean that it is actually gramatically correct to do so.</p></div>
