            <h2>Our location</h2>
            <p>We will be located locally, in Plaquemine. Our only requirements for a location are proximity to
                residence, good internet, and availability of performance computer parts. Because of the internet,
                anyone can buy anything from anywhere; and this allows us to be located anywhere. We do not need
                <i>performant</i> internet because our business wouldn't perceive any benefit and it would be an
                unnecessary expense. Therefore, we could operate our business (<i>almost</i>) anywhere with a good
                internet infastructure. Which leaves us to one final requirement: proximity to residence. We have
                options for decent internet in Plaquemine, and we live in close proximity, so it would be most
                reasonable to operate locally.</p>

        <div class="textBox">
            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p>I do not anticipate having any serious competition. There is no business within 15 miles of our chosen
                location that would be serious competition. However, there is a locally owned RadioShack in town, but I
                do no anticipate serious competition from them because we provide a broader range of products that we
                make ourselves, while Radio Shack is just a small retail store.</p>

                        games without sacreficing the <i>quality</i> of the software or the <i>rich</i> content our

                        performant and aesthetic without an inflated cost. We will also offer modified referbished
                        computers of close quality but at a lower price.</p>

                    <h3>We are well-rounded</h3>
                    <p>Most computer companies are either software <i>or</i> hardware, with few that do both, and
                        (virtually) none master both. Computer companies that try to do both almost always either rely
                        on purchasing another company to do one while they do the other, or they aren't good at either.

            <h2>Us VS. Comparable Companies</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <p>Apple is an interesting point of comparison. Apple is both a software and hardware company, and they do
                both really well. However, Apple has a very different philosophy for running a business and aesthetics.
                Apple doesn't run a business with their own self interest as first priority, but that doesn't mean they
                don't care about the consumer. Apple prioritizes the consumer second. Historically, Apple has always
                been highly oppressive about their policies and restrictions for their platforms. For example, Apple is
                very strict about what you can and cannot do with their products. Apple makes it very hard and expensive
                for developers to create for their platforms, like the iPhone. Apple also charges excessive amounts of
                money, for their hardware. For example, the <i>CHEAPEST</i> new MacBook available to purchase is over
                $1,000 now and the hardware is only worth about $500. Apple also charges over $300 for a $7 RAM chip,
                and $400 for $40 flash storage chip in a MacBook. We will create both software and hardware that is
                accessible, cheap, and easy for third party developers. We also prioritize the consumer over our own
                company. For example, if we release an office product and a customer has a problem with it, we will make
                sure that it gets resolved so the consumer is happy, no matter how much it may cost the company. If we
                release a mobile messaging app and a customer wants to be able to cusomize the interface beyond just
                light and dark mode, we will work our hardest to accomplish it. If the customer sees a point of
                improvement to be made in our products, we will improve it. Our products will also be open for people to
                do what they want with them (within reason).</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Microsoft</h3>
            <p>This one is quick. While Microsoft is open about how you use their hardware and software, they are an
                anti-consumer, monopolistic, and anti-competitive company. They don't make very good hardware, and their
                software is very flawed and buggy. Microsoft, much like Apple, regularly charges over $1,000 for $300
                computers. We <i>actually</i> care about the consumer and treat our competition fairly. We also make
                sure that all software is complete, bugs are patched, and flaws are fixed before release. We will not
                release hardware unless it is good and worth while for the customer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Nintendo</h3>
            <p>While Nintendo doesn't make computers, they still do make both hardware and software very well. Their
                games are enjoyable and replayable. Their hardware is unique and creative. Nintendo is also (mostly)
                accessible to developers on their platforms. However, just like Microsoft, Nintendo is an anti-consumer
                company. Nintendo frequently abuses online content reporting and DMCA systems. For example, Nintendo
                goes after small content creators with copyright strikes claiming they are using Nintendo's music for
                purposes unintended by Nintendo, while they do not go after larger content creators who do the same
                thing. Additionally, just like Apple, Nintendo is very oppressive and strict about what you do with
                their products. We will be very open with our hardware and software, and we will allow assets like music
                in our video games to be used freely without restrictions.</p>

            <h2>Employees</h2>
            <p>I will need 3 employees. One employee for social media and advertising, one employee for accounting, and
                one employee for dealing with customers. Each of the employees will rotate on who cleans up after
                closing. However, each employee will also help, at least a little, with creating big software, like
                games.</p>
