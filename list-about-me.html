    <h3>List of things:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Member of PC Master Race</li>
        <li>Game and web dev as a pass time</li>
        <li>Apparently, I'm somehow both a "nerd" & a "geek" simultaneously. Which I've heard is rare</li>
        <li>It takes n+1 wipes to realize you only need n wipes.</li>
        <li>QWERTZ is superior</li>
        <li>Ambivert</li>
        <li>I find complex math fun</li>
        <li>I taught myself a little about quantum mechanics</li>
        <li>QUANTUM SUPREMACY!</li>
        <li>I can read numbers in ASCII binary</li>
        <li>I can read base-16 (hexadecimal) numbers</li>
        <li>I can read practically any base number system, as long as I have a calculator and something to write on (obviously I would need something to write with as well)</li>
        <li>I can read any alphabetical language, I just don't understand most of them</li>
        <li>I sometimes feel held back from my potential</li>
        <li>I feel out of place around most people</li>
        <li>I don't know what my potential is, but I always feel like I can do more</li>
        <li>Christian</li>
        <li>I enjoy old electronics</li>
        <li>I have a VHS, video game, cassette, DVD, CD, and vinyl collection</li>
        <li>I like listening to the Beetles</li>
        <li>I prefer YouTube Music over Spotify</li>
        <li>I prefer Android over IOS</li>
        <li>I prefer Linux, but I am bound by Windows due to software support</li>
        <li>I always believed that 90% of people don't have good enough passwords</li>
        <li>A good password is the kind that's unreadable without being a geek, too long for most to remember, and easy to forget</li>
        <li>I enjoy science</li>
        <li>A vacation isn't a vacation if you're constantly doing something. A vacation is being relaxed in a place where you normally wouldn't be at. For example, a mountainside condo with a large balcony and a view you can't look away from</li>
        <li>I learned how to code in Scratch when I was in around 5th or 6th grade</li>
        <li>I watch a lot of LTT videos</li>
        <li>At school, people find me weird, but some find it interesting.</li>
        <li>At practically everywhere but my school most find me nerdy or geeky.</li>
        <li>I don't think I'm a geek or a nerd, I think I'm somewhere in between.</li>
        <li>I occasionally log onto Twitch to watch live streams and VODs</li>
        <li>I think that most TikTok users are social media addicts</li>
        <li>I think people that say that gamers are addicted are gross social media addicts and can't go a day without thinking about social media or TikTok.</li>
        <li>I don't use social media. YouTube doesn't count a social media, it's just media because there's no real social aspect of it (comments do not count because they are intended to be just opinions, not conversations). Twitch doesn't necessarily count as social media, it just depends on what you're watching. Lastly, Reddit doesn't count as social media because it's intended to be a forum website but people misuse it and proclaim it to be a social media platform without actually considering what it is intended to be (even the UI says that it's a forum website, not social media because it would've been designed very differently otherwise)</li>
        <li>I hate TikTokers and I don't consider them to be part of the human race because they are weird creatures that annoy and harass everyone else making everyone else around them uncomfortable and dislike them for the sake of getting someone they will never see or physically interact to like them</li>
        <li>I've been told that I am really good that understanding people (even if I've never seen them before) and why they do things as well as how they would react in specific circumstances</li>
        <li>I don't like being a leader</li>
        <li>There's no place like 127.0.0.1, which is why I like spending time at 127.0.0.1</li>
        <li>People are weird</li>
        <li>I wonder what's waiting around every corner of life and enjoy predicting what will happen and the result of it</li>
        <li>My family likes traveling a lot</li>
        <li>I can't do most of my everyday computing tasks without at least a midrange PC</li>
        <li>I don't understand why the ARM architecture isn't used everywhere</li>
        <li>I don't like nature very much</li>
        <li>I'm indifferent about driving, but would rather not if I don't have to</li>
        <li>I find it cumbersome to code on a phone</li>
        <li>I sometimes come up with ideas that surprise me no one has already done that I can find, yet I get them at the most inconvenient time and rarely get a chance to write them down before forgetting.</li>
        <li>I have a terrible memory sometimes</li>
        <li>I ordered my Steam Deck on September 11th (9/11)</>
