            <h2>Stoichiometric Bicycloptic Rage</h2>
            <p>There once was a person named "The." "The" had a problem. "The"'s pet named "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination" was
                sick. So "The" left his house to bring "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination" to a vet named "UserId:34578932475" who
                worked at a place named "Doctor's complex." "The" died from a heart attack and "UserId:34578932475"'s finger
                slipped, killing "Bi-cycloptic Hallucination." "UserId:34578932475" was killed by a stray bullet after work
                while walking to his car, and "Doctor's complex" blew up, destroying everything within 5,652,733 miles.</p>
              <p>For some reason, unknown to the narrator, a strand of DNA has appeared on a separate planet in the Andromeda
                Galaxy. Remembering what he was looking for, he went to search for his keys. "The" then dived into the
                Milky-Way's central blackhole. "The" found his keys. However, he was never seen again, because nothing, other
                than light, can escape a blackhole, also "The" would be speggetified.</p>
              <p>This wasn't the end however; "The" found himself, somehow, in <i>another</i> planet. This mission to find his keys
                has become exponential. He looked around the magical land he was in. There was a candy cane forest, in which
                "The" found a cabin. He began to knock at the door. "Hello? Anyone there?" He received no response. "Nobody must
                be home," he said to himself. "The" went on to explore more of his surroundings, finding unnatual terrain
                everywhere.</p>
              <p>Then, God, the teenager living in his mom's basement pressed "close application" when the universe simulator
                stopped responding. He was distraught to find out his progress didn't save. He only had 5 minutes to recover it
                before it was lost forever.</p>
              <p>Turns out, that data was only half recovered. This meant trouble for God. "This is going to be more difficult
                than I thought," God said to himself. He had to figure out how to fix this, and fast. He decided the only thing
                he could do was to restart his computer in hopes that it was all just a bug. It turned out that it was, so he
                signed with relief. God restored his previous save, from before humanity fell to crap. God said "It is good."
