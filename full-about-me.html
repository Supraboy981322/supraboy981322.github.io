<title>Full About Me - Zane's Website</title>
<div class="about-me-expanded">
    <b><center>Hello, I am Zane Sanders! At the time of writing this, I'm 16 years old. I live in the United States of America. I enjoy math, science, programming, drawing, 3d modeling, 2d modeling, video game development, graphic design, web design, and much more. I've not much experience with 3d game development, but I've done a lot with 2d game development. For games, I primarily use Scratch in TurboWarp, because I know it better than other languages. I'm also autistic and I have ADHD. I've been told by several people (including my some of my teachers) that I'm very smart and could very well achieve greatness one day. I often ponder on what that greatness could be, and if they're just saying that for motivation. I've had teachers tell me I remind them of Einstien and I've been told by a few of my peers that me and a friend of mine could be the next Bill Gates and Paul Allen. I've even been told I remind them of the many stories of Elon Musk's teenage years. I often have lots of ideas, but I struggle to write most of them down quick enough, while still being legible, before I forget. I honestly don't know what I plan to do in the future because I enjoy all of technology, and I'm not particularly better at one thing than another. Currently, I'm leaning towards the side of web development, but I also enjoy hardware engineering, so it's hard to decide.</center></b>
